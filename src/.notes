1. What is considered interesting under the REGION_HEAP_STACK_EXECUTABLE?
    1.1 It needs to have read permission
    1.2 It needs to have write permission
    1.3 It needs to have size greater than 0
    1.4 If the filename is the same name as the executalbe (that is in /proc/pid/exe), then it is interesting
    1.5 Otherwise, if filename is empty, it is interesting. (equivalently, it has offset 0)
    1.6 If it is the HEAP or the Stack, it is interesting

    The following steps SHOULD get the desired files

    1. Get all the mapper files
    2. Remove those who do not have Read permission
    3. Remove those who do not have Write permission
    4. Remove those who have offset greater than 0
        WITH THE EXCEPTION, of the one who has execname on it's file description
